# :fire: ESP32C3 VOICE LED

All the final files needed for the project are provided here and you can use them directly. You just need to follow the steps below to have your own VOICE LED:

1. Download the [ESP32C3_VOICE_LED_PCB.PcbDoc](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led/blob/main/PCB/ESP32C3_VOICE_LED_PCB.PcbDoc) file and send it to the factory for processing, you will get a circuit board.
2. Download the [ESP32C3_VOICE_LED_PCB_Project.pdf](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led/blob/main/PCB/ESP32C3_VOICE_LED_PCB_Project.pdf) file and solder your circuit board according to this schematic.
3. Download the [hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led_v1.0.zip](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led/releases/download/v1.0/hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led_v1.0.zip) file and use the official burning tool to burn the firmware into the MCU. Please see the burning steps: [You can also directly burn the released bin file](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp32c3_voice_led/blob/main/README.md)
4. Download the [hoozz_play_release_v3.0.apk](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_android/releases/download/v3.0/hoozz_play_release_v3.0.apk) file and install the apk to your phone.

Okay, you're ready to start playing
