# :fire: ESP8266 Sensor

All final files required for the project are provided, so there is no need to compile the source code. You just need to follow these steps to have your own remote computer switch:

1. Download the [ESP8266_SENSOR_PCB_X.PcbDoc](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp8266_sensor/tree/main/PCB) file and send it to the factory for processing, you will get a circuit board.
2. Download the [ESP8266_SENSOR_Sheet_X.SchDoc](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp8266_sensor/tree/main/PCB) file and solder your circuit board according to this schematic.
3. Download the [hoozz_play_esp8266_sensor_release_vx.x.zip](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp8266_sensor/releases) file and use the official burning tool to burn the firmware into the MCU. Please see the burning steps: [Burn the released bin file](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_esp8266_sensor/blob/main/README.md)
4. Download the [hoozz_play_release_vx.x.apk](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_android/releases) file and install the apk to your phone.

Okay, you're ready to start playing
