The final files required for all projects have been provided, so compiling the source code is not necessary. You only need to follow the following steps to have your own thermal imager:

1. Download the [MLX90640_PCB.PcbDoc](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_mlx90640/blob/master/PCB/MLX90640_PCB.PcbDoc) file and send it to the factory for processing, you will get a circuit board.
2. Download the [MLX90640_Sheet.SchDoc](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_mlx90640/blob/master/PCB/MLX90640_Sheet.SchDoc) file and solder your circuit board according to this schematic.
3. Download the [GD32F350G8U6TR_MLX90640_V1.0.hex](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_mlx90640/releases/download/v1.0/GD32F350G8U6TR_MLX90640_V1.0.hex) file and use the official burning tool to burn the firmware into the MCU.
4. You need an Android phone, which needs a typc-c interface.
5. Download the [hoozz_play_release_v1.0.apk](https://github.com/huxiangjs/hoozz_play_android/releases/download/v1.0/hoozz_play_release_v1.0.apk) file and install the apk to your phone.
